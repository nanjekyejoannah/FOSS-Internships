# Open Source Paid Internships

This is a collection of paid Open source internships  that I have come across. Most require that you are a student but others do not require being a student. I prepared this as a good summary for Makerere Students that want to know opportunities in open source after their Internship with the Linux Kernel.

Carefully read the associated links to get more details on how to apply. Good Luck. If I have left out any please open a pull request and I will add the internship.
